# 100 Days of Code Log - 2019 EDITION BABY üéâ (The Reckoning) üòú

**Inspiration:** Wanted to do continue on the path of learning and improving myself and since I couldn't decide how best to proceed, I asked those more knowlegeable than me - and my peeps üòÄ ü§ó - see the [tweet](https://twitter.com/dsbrux/status/1092845223414325249?s=20).
This time around I think I will be giving myself 1 day a week OFF, usually Sundays, but let's see where my obsession takes me üòÖ.

**Trello:** If you don't want to be reading this long log constantly. I'm creating and updating a **PUBLIC** - as in like the internet -  personal trello board. See it [here](https://trello.com/b/uxmRcL5M/roadmap-2019).

**NOTE:** I will be updating this readme as I go along; adding some fiiles, links, etc.., maybe even do some minor design or whatever, but wanted to get things started.

To get the actual count just run the following snippet:

```js
// # Note this is using flow. Remove the typechecking to run it on the console.

/* @flow */
const count = (days: number=0): number|string => {
  if (days) {
    return days;
  }
  return "Code me some ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (*finger snap*)";
}

console.assert(count() === 100, "Wrong"); // <= undefined :)
console.assert(count(100) === 0, "Wrong"); // <= Wrong
```

**Start Date** 06 Feb. 2019

  - [x] Setting up.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time setting repos (log + weather-app-node) and getting everything "ready". I have enrolled on this course last year and completed Sections 1 - 3. I had stopped at Section 4. So starting at the beggining of Section 4 again. üí™

- Read one page of Chapter 2 YDKJS Book 3: "This & Object Prototypes"
  - `this` All Makes Sense Now
    - Nothing but rules
      - [x]  Default Binding

**Thoughts:** Will like to write a blog post after I finish the chapter.

Thanks to the Udemy course understanding and because I'm happening to be reading the book and doing the course at the same time - **by coincidence** - I'm actually understanding better when and where to spot the `call-site`, `call-stack` of each `fn`, and how all this relates to the `event-loop` and the `node-apis` in Node.
